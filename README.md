#Indoor Environment Air Quality Monitor & Smart Switch

#Abstract
Indoor air quality sensor and smart switch was implemented to understand the
applications of internet of things devices. The circuit of the project contains multiple
hardware components with Raspberry Pi 4. The device takes real-time inputs and when
the air quality is toxic, it sends a notification to the user informing that the air quality is
toxic and the system will trigger the air purifier on. Once the sensor tests the air quality
to be normal again, it turns-off the air purifier and the cycle continues. The objective of
the project was to promote a healthy indoor environment. Second objective of the
project was to turn any purifier into a smart purifier using the Rf switch, transmitter and
receiver. The real-data monitoring happens in the system with the help of AdaFruit. All
of the components of the circuit are controlled with the help of Python libraries and
code.
